I was never big on going out to parties because I had no interest in getting in trouble, and I hate the taste of beer. I got invited to a house party with some girls from my floor my second semester. It was their weekly routine and they had never gotten busted so I figured why not. It was not my kind of party…blaring music, too many people jammed together in a dirty dingy basement, barely knew anyone there and nothing..."<br><br><br><a href="http://www.bravemissworld.com/share_your_story/last-party">Taken from Brave Miss World</a>

When I got to college, I started drinking a lot because I could and it was fun. I attended my first frat party before school had even begun and lost my virginity that night. After that, I decided that it didn’t matter anymore and I had a string of one night stands after frat parties. I neither consented nor denied, they just happened.
