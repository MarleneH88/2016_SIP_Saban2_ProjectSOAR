<p><strong>Our goal</strong> is to build a community of people who know that they are
<strong>not alone.</strong> <br>

Too many people, when they try to speak up about what happened to them, are told that they are wrong, that they are at fault, and that they need to step down.

We are here to tell you that you should never stop telling your story, and that you are safe here.

<hr>
<p>&quot;I was a freshman in college at a school only a short distance from my home staying on campus to get the “full college experience”. I was never big on going out to parties because I had no interest in getting in trouble, and I hate the taste of beer. I got
 invited to a house party with some girls from my floor my second semester. It was their weekly routine and they had never gotten busted so I figured why not. It was not my kind of party…blaring music, too many people jammed together in a dirty dingy basement,
 barely knew anyone there and nothing...&quot;<br>

<h2 class="intro-text text-center"><strong>&quot;Naive College Freshman&quot;</strong> </h2>
<hr>
<p>&quot;I was only 18. I wanted to save myself for marriage, and had managed to make it through a year long high school romance without having sex. When I got to college, I started drinking a lot because I could and it was fun. I attended my first frat party before
 school had even begun and lost my virginity that night. After that, I decided that it didn’t matter anymore and I had a string of one night stands after frat parties. I neither consented nor denied, they just happened. But, one evening stands out from the
 rest. A guy that I was acquainted with invited me and a friend over for wine and a movie. I got pretty drunk. He may have slipped roofies into it, but I don’t...&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;On September 31st I was raped. Very few people know this about me. I’m too scared to tell anyone. How do I even tell someone? How do I handle the way my parents would look at me knowing? My friends? How could I go to the police? Tell my story over and over
